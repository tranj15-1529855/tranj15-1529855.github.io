	<p><font face="verdana" color="green">The cards were designed with slits on both ends symmetrically. The user then builds and free standing structure they would like, securing each on into another. The cards really let loose and encourage the user to be free minded and creative as possible. I like that all the cards all have different prints because any and every structure you make will be unique. You won’t find yourself in search of “that one card that matches the others” so that your tower will be perfect. Rather there is no repeating pattern in the cards you use, other than the structure itself.</font></p>
	<p><font face="helvetica" color="teal">The images to the left depict variations in prints that Eames printed on the cards. They show how the cards can be used on a much larger scale and how users can build much larger objects than anticipated. One of the images also give the user ideas as to what he/she can create.</font></p>
